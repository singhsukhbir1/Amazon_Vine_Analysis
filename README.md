# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid and unpaid Amazon Vine Program.
## Results
The results for the [Vine(Paid)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTjI8P9JVb2v5egDF_2i1oxBZdDcWpnv/view?usp=sharing) and [non-Vine(Unpaid)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16x75gM5fEb6bd9pvdMN4_cXD0fbLiPfQ/view?usp=sharing) Vine reviews are as follows: 

- There are a total of 613 Vine and 64968 non-Vine reviews in the dataset.
- For the 5-stars reviews category, there are 222 Vine and 30543 non-Vine reviews.
- The percentage of 5-star Vine reviews is 36.21%. However, the percentage of 5-star non-Vine reviews is 47.01%.

## Summary
To summarize, the total number of 5-star Vine reviews (613) is very small in comparison to the non-Vine reviews(64968). Therefore, we can say that there is a very positive bias for non-Vine reviews. 
We can perform one additional analysis by comparing the results of both Vine and non-Vine reviews against each other. This can help us get a clear idea of the total percentage of reviews in the total dataset.
